	// Sync is whether to synchronize writes through os buffer cache and down onto the actual disk.
	// Setting sync is required for durability of a single write operation, but also results in slower writes.
	//
	// If false, and the machine crashes, then some recent writes may be lost.
	// Note that if it is just the process that crashes (machine does not) then no writes will be lost.

	// In other words, Sync being false has the same semantics as a write
	// system call. Sync being true means write followed by fsync.
	Sync bool

	// BytesPerSync specifies the number of bytes to write before calling fsync.
